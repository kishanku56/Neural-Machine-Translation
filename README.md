**Neural Machine Translation (English → Hindi)**

This project was implemented as part of the CS779: Statistical Natural Language Processing course at IIT Kanpur during my first semester of 2025.

The system was evaluated in the CodaBench English–Hindi NMT Competition:

Training Phase Rank: 9 / 120

Test Phase Rank: 24 / 120
